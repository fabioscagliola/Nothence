Do not run, otherwise you will sweat\
Wait at least one more hour 'fore taking a bath\
I was wearing a condom, but we might have touched\
This may be sign of a tumor

The ghost of diarrhea's always haunting me\
I could get stuck in a traffic jam\
Should you need it, a toilet must always be near\
– I must not run out of my drops

No way

I wish I could free my mind from all these worries for once at least before I die\
I wish I forgot all my fears and remember to live

Hey, dad, do you recall when you used to go out?\
What if I were allergic to what I just ate?\
In a week I'll freak out to get on that plane\
No one ever will listen to this

When we left, did you notice if I locked the door?\
He's not picking up; something may be wrong with him\
Flashing lights may trigger epilepsy\
– I must not run out of my drops
