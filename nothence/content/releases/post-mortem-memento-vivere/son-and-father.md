Son is happy when Father plays with him\
He's not afraid of darkness; he wonders if Father is\
His tiny hand clung to Father's huge forefinger\
They walk towards his room, wherever it may be

But Father's sitting, while he should kneel on the floor\
He would only focus on what he is concerned of\
Bored, Son leaves, walks out of his room\
He does not have to turn the light off: Father is still there

He'll be back\
Hell, be back

«Beautiful Mother\
Kiss me welcome home\
Hug me with arms and legs, and call\
"Hey, Son, Father's home"»\
And Son shivers\
Watching Father as he comes\
While he's still playing with Father\
In his room

Son drives the car backwards out of the garage\
Looking in the rearview mirror, like Father does\
Will she wait for him on top of that hill?\
More beautiful and graceful than Mother she will be

The road is steep and he can barely see\
Turn after turn, like Father would, he climbs\
Leaving all behind was never taken into account\
He wonders if he will remember, when he comes back

He finds a body\
Rotting on the lawn\
Greener than ever\
Around his shiny new home\
And he shivers\
Looking at the corpse\
Features unrecognizable\
It's wearing Mother's clothes
