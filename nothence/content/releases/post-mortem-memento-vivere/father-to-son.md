Just gone to bed, I've been studying till late\
My alarm going off in a handful of hours\
Not asleep yet when I hear the call of my fate\
The one sound that can trigger a father's superpowers

I wrap up your micro-bottom in a clean nappy\
You fit my forearm, the mouth of a young cuckoo\
Cling to the baby bottle and drink till you're happy\
Hiccup, smile, kiss goodnight, my arms around you

I had you in one hand and a book in the other\
I had all I needed to walk into the future\
Though I did not assess the cost of being a father\
I did not expect it would cause any rupture

I might have lost some pieces along the way\
And there have been some times when I had no clue\
But It looks like in the end I just had to wait\
What I was, am, and will be, I owe it to you

You may say I just did what had to be done\
You may say in my shoes you would have done the same\
Wandering aimlessly, while I could have potentially run\
If I hadn't got you, It would have been a shame

Twenty-three years do not give you a lot of insight\
Stay? Go? Left? Right? Fate? Do you think I knew?\
The will to endure had been taught to me right\
Not a goal to pursue â€” that I owe to you

Be aware of your potential, don't be lame\
The strength to achieve lies asleep in your chest\
Deep inside you can always find the thrust to aim\
For the best, the zest; don't jest, don't rest

You're to be the one on which you place your bet\
Do not waste your life to some worthless foo\
All these things I've done with no regret\
If there's ever been a reason, the reason was you
