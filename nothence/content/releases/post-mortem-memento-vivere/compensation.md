So many joyful creatures\
The tears fill their eyes\
Never reveal their features\
And drop down the disguise

The burden of a feather\
Conveys the bare essential\
The two of them together\
Release their full potential

It's compensation

Amassing the frustration\
The act of self-disposal\
The relief of temptation\
Lead to the obscene proposal

Blindfolded sign the agreement\
Each other's marionette\
The scanty act is vehement\
Joy gives way to regret
