Sorry I've missed your call before\
And then I haven't called you back\
I knew you would have called again

Don't worry: everything's alright\
I wasn't doing anything\
Just seeing people, doing stuff

Of course I've been at school today\
I would have told you, otherwise\
Why do you keep on asking me?

I talked to grandpa the other night\
He told me everything about what\
You were like when you were my age

I got my dark side just like you: I'm your son

I've always trusted you\
You've always been there for me\
It's your time to trust me now\
I don't want to disappoint you

Yes, dad, I know you love me\
And you know I'll always love you\
But I've got my life to live now\
Please, let me go

You always did the best you could\
You always gave me all you had\
You were my hero, as a kid

You're not the tallest anymore\
You taught me everything you know, now\
Please let me make my own mistakes

The seed you planted long ago\
Is growing branches around me\
You're always here, protecting me

I've never heard you blame grandpa\
For anything that could go wrong\
I won't blame you for my mistakes

I learned your strength â€” which makes you proud\
Don't you worry about your ghosts\
I'll deal with them just like you: I'm your son
