Of my bigot loveless mother\
At the mercy of my period\
Always anxious to be anxious\
See no reason to get out of bed

Giving others not receiving\
Unable of loving myself\
Who's the woman in the mirror?\
Even though my belly's full I still feel empty

You cannot drain me I am already drowned\
Down to the floor of my pitiless self\
Don't condescend me, don't patronize\
I'm sick and tired of your countless lies

My tattoo, nails, hair are my own\
I'm the one who measures my weight\
Drinks and smoking are my choices\
Psychopathic exes can burn down in hell

Of your counterfeited friendships\
All your non-requested advice\
Why do you care about my outfit?\
In front of me you wouldn't stand one chance

You cannot drain me I am already drowned\
Down to the floor of my pitiless self\
Don't condescend me, don't patronize\
I'm sick and tired of your shameful lies

I'm a survivor, I'm not going to fight\
Elbowing my way throughout all this mess\
Better watch out for my storm is to come\
The clock is ticking, you reap what you sow
