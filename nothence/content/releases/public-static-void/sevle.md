Through the ash\
That my clear eyes\
Obfuscate and conceal

You alone\
Could enthuse\
The elf of future worlds

Beyond the infinite\
Nouns and their opposites\
In which we have declined

Behind the distant\
Transmutation\
In which we've transfigured

We strive to hide the love that remains\
I know, you know\
Though years have passed\
Still sometimes nothing signifies without you

Sparks at first touch\
Fire blows up\
Burns us down 'til consumed

Being attracted\
Then repelled\
Nearness annihilates

Ash and mud\
Hazy shards\
My best friend your fallback

Hope bled out\
Disaffection\
I beg you let me go

We had to learn to live apart\
We know, he knows\
Charming bud of summer morning blossomed\
When your blond angel perched on your lap
