Among my fields\
Of gold and green\
Sticky bounds are marked by silkworm-eaten rows of mulberry trees\
Concrete pipes are growing from the ground

Scattered ranks\
Of different heights\
Every concrete pipe contains another one of transparent glass\
Inside each glass pipe stands a naked man

Bodies lacking motion\
Sunk in amniotic fluid\
Their underdeveloped eyes can't see\
Still they look up to the skies

And they sing\
Till the skies are blue\
No matter what\
They sing\
Despite everything\
They keep on singing out

No air streams\
Through their nostrils\
Not one bubble rises up through the thick fluid from their lungs\
The emanation is a flow of melody

Through their substance\
They carry impressions\
The pipes of the organ harmonically vibrate alive\
Drawing melodies from their deep common ground

And they sing\
Till the skies are blue\
No matter what\
They sing\
Despite everything\
They do nothing but

Sing\
They don't give a damn\
If no one listens\
They sing\
If you're there or not\
They're not singing for you
