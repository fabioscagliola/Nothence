How do you feel? Boat\
How old are you? Dog\
If this is real\
I refuse to believe it

Purr the cat woman\
Pollution in her bowl\
Resentment and bottles\
Coffee cup, cat, sun

Where is your god now?\
Away from here

Creating sinners\
Too busy suffering to death\
Set himself hanging from a cross\
Away from here\
He doesn't love us\
Just like a parent does\
I would have never let this happen\
To you, my son

Dark empty room\
Down on my knees\
Your hand on my shoulder\
Puke light to the ceiling

Glide on the woods\
Chop trees throwing lightnings\
Adopt match-headed kids\
Coffee cup, cat, sun

Where is your god now?\
Away from here

Manipulators\
Try to persuade us\
We must be suffering to death\
Driven by fear\
Mass fancy vision\
Either I don't know what love is\
Or he does not love us at all\
Away from here
