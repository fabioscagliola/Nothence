Lighthouse, out in the darkness\
Bearer of delightful gifts\
Loner not meant to meet\
Outsider\
Supposed to see not one other light

Makers spread them away\
Preventing them from crossing their beams\
If ever rays should reflect\
Lighthouses\
Would become aware of each other's existence

Terrified at first\
Have never seen a light\
Before their own\
What they were kept away from is here\
Inspire each other\
Project away their fear\
Mutually urge\
Creative escalation

Lighthouses, sooner or later\
Sadly resign to seclusion\
Emanate for no one else\
Lonely\
Eventually they turn off their light

Earthquake, displacing plates\
Floating over the tide\
Bump into each other\
Lighthouses\
Meet and can barely believe their own senses

Their engraved reflections\
Holograms of their love\
Becoming one\
Makers who could create themselves\
Their chains now broken\
Shadow away diseases\
When lighthouses meet\
The gods themselves contend in vain
