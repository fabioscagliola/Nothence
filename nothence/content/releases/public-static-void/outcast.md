Consumerism foundation\
Capitalism in control\
Society\
Hollow hypocrisy

You spend your days in self-exile\
Locked in your self-forged golden cage\
At times it feels\
More like rusty cocoon

Loner, not misanthropist\
Years spent as a recluse\
Lack of communication\
Die from social starvation

You need to be a part of it\
If you want to survive\
Obey the rules to some extent\
To reintegrate yourself\
You'll never fully conform\
But you have to come to terms\
Any achievement of yours is\
Only real when it's shared

Wake up in your life's changing room\
Buried by piles of dismissed clothes\
You can't remember\
What you look like when you're naked

When you have nothing left to lose\
Can tear away the clothes your wear\
To play your role\
In this life's fucking lie
