The man in the mirror talks despite my lips\
He continues moving, though I just stand still\
Laughs at what I do and preaches what I should\
I reach out hands to his neck, only punch the glass

Take the mirror off the wall\
Lift it up, then drop it on my head

Unite my two selves\
Drip blood on splintered glass

Wish I felt the mirror bend and fit my shape\
Melt down, wrap my body, penetrate my lungs\
At last I meet my man and we become one\
Or shards will cut my throat and I will bleed to death
