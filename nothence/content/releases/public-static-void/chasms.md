Floating on the sea of unconscious\
Hold your breath and look down to the bottom\
Like a cracked and leaking wall of sound

Streams are flowing through the chasms, split the surface into plates\
Take a bottle drink it down, wish you emanated less\
Void and dissonant vibrations

Dive deep enough to reach the streams\
Flowing out of inner chasms\
Draw and drink it from the source and\
Your aura vibrates in unison

The sensitive may dare, the sufferer was there\
You have nothing left to loï»¿se, you have nothing left to fear\
Face the darkest chasms, drink from the stream

Light's pulsating in the core, blinded by surrounding dark\
You are held back by the fear of obscurity\
Tied hands are striving for the source

Leave the empty bottle floating\
A muse is chanting your way\
Share your wondering with the wanderer and\
Feel auras vibrate in unison
