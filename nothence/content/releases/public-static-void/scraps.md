Persistent feeling of ill will\
Though I resent no injury\
Open wounds and scars

So many tales to tell the world, but no one listens

Together we contribute\
To universal beauty\
Too bad it won't last

Nature creates its self-destruction weapons

Under the shower clairvoyance\
Tentatively reanimate\
Love dying\
Balls aching\
Watch TV\
Against melancholia

Lethargic turtle, curlew's nest\
Hand-feed me, change my diaper\
My happy pill please!

Dare not, don't praise me, masturbate my ego

Drunk till the ocean, got lost\
Scum feels attractive when it lures flies\
Don't rub your breasts on me

Your cock is not with you, not here, tonight
