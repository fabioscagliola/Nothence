In my twisted inner city\
Till the darkness' eyes are shut, I see\
I don't want to spend much time aware, for I could feel\
All the vacuousness surrounding me\
Swallowed up, where everything connects\
Stuff myself within to compensate\
Hear your footsteps getting closer in the corridor\
Play my music louder over it

Identities conflict\
My altered memories\
Dissociate myself from me\
Disorder rises\
Pulses to escape

I don't want to run away\
Please don't let this be again\
Take my hand and make me stay\
Tell me it's going to be ok

Still remember how it burst\
Now I freeze when you get close to me\
I'm too scared to take a deeper dive into myself\
Where nothing is forever anymore\
Stiffening time by jerking it is vain\
You cry away your makeup, red-eyed cloud\
When your perfume burns like flashes knocking on my door\
I pretend I'm playing too loud to hear
