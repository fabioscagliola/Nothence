He had lived some time\
He had been through quite some things\
He knew what love is\
And he learned how the pain feels

Before he met her\
He thought he was complete\
He used to be his own protection\
Then he realized\
That all he had built so far\
Was nothing in the instant that she looked into his eyes, and he said:

«Are you real? Or do you exist only in my head?\
Come as you are, step into my world\
And let it admire you\
Make it yours\
Come in as you are\
And you'll be\
As I wished you would be»

Honest mistakes\
He did make big ones\
A journey together\
He had never thought of

Before he met her\
He thought he was complete\
He used to be his own protection\
Then he realized\
That all he had built so far\
Was nothing since the first time that she looked into his eyes, and he said:

«Are you real? Or do you exist only in my head?\
Come as you are, step into my world\
And let it admire you\
Make it yours\
Come in as you are\
And you'll be\
As I wished you would be»
