Who am I to bear the load they want to share with me?!\
Have I ever wished to be the perfect listener?!\
She may not be productive, but she knows how to shake her ass\
They both leave early and come late - nobody's blind inhere

He's too hungry after years of role-playing frustration and\
He cannot see the look upon the faces of his family and his friends\
He gave her the job and now he promises she'll have his heart one day\
Maybe she's in love... until the day she'll realize\
And then guess what...\
Don't look at me!\
Shut your mouth and close your eyes

As I earn their confidence I put his role at risk\
Should I care about the balance and cut all the rumors down?!\
Repellently attractive - something about her\
Am I really going to help him or somehow I envy him?!

He got blinded by a candle in the dark room of responsibilities\
Who am I to open up his eyes and help him see the truth?!\
From the moment he denied, I realized he'd never be a friend\
Threatened by his mirror image, turned his men into his slaves\
And then guess what...\
Don't dare to look at me!\
Shut your mouth and close your eyes

## About

Despite the title, this song is one of the least introspective: it actually tells a story of people interacting at the mercy of frustration, lust for power, and will of self-affirmation upon others.
