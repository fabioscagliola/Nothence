I don't want to see that empty room\
I don't want to walk in there alone\
Too much light will blind my eyes\
Empty like the hall beyond the skies

Lock the door\
Leave it all behind\
I don't want to see the empty room\
He will come to find\
When the lions roar\
Sirens disappearing from his mind

Will you walk with me inside the room?\
Will I help you wear the shiny dress?\
I don't know if that suits you\
Or am I just too scared to let you in?

## About

The "empty room" (my very special thanks go to CB for suggesting me this vision) represents the void left by the absence of a presence we were used to; at times this might be scary, but we need to come to terms with it, and let it become part of our everyday life experience.
