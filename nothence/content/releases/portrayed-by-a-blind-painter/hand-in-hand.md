Dreamt a non-molded being\
In the darkest emptiness\
A fetus of pale white\
Emitting light of consciousness\
Approaching, the creature grows\
Evolving into a man\
Unfinished albino\
His face's got no identity

Beings invoked by a god\
Too afraid to grow old\
Feel inadequate to\
Walk with him hand in hand

Here and now, he can bend\
Space and time to his will\
As he drinks from the chalice\
Individuals become one\
Hair falls out of his body\
Covered by primordial ooze\
Those who respond to the call\
Give up reality

They leave their ego behind\
Not afraid to become\
What they were meant to be\
Now they walk hand in hand

## About

An allegorical story, a dream of evolution, about reclaiming our true essence by dropping the habits we wear, held back by our fears.
