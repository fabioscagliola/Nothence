The cat scratches the kid\
Daddy slaps the cat\
Mommy wakes up drunk\
And unleashes her hell

When I look into your\
Eyes and my heart trembles\
Hope my nose starts bleeding\
So I won't forget

No more tries are needed\
My skin carries your scars\
Thanks for the reminder\
I won't forget

Here is where I breathe\
You don't fit in here\
I've got my ghosts to fight\
Get out of my place

Next time when I see you\
And butterflies flap their wings\
Hope my nose starts bleeding\
So I won't forget

No more tries are needed\
I've got enough scars to lick\
Thanks for the reminder\
I won't forget

## About

Unhealable optimism makes us forget, and therefore forgive. Fixing memories of real-life incidents when they leave their mark on us, as taking pictures of scars before they fade away, may help us remember.
