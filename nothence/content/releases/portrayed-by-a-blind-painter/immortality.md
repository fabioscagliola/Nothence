Do you ever think that you would\
Actually would kill yourself?

If I ever thought about it\
Yes, then I believe I would

Some die just to live

## About

I consider this song to be my humble tribute to grunge. You may say there is a lot of Nirvana in the music, as well as a lot of Pearl Jam in the lyrics: «Some die just to live» is actually the last line of "Immortality", and the rest of the lyrics is an adaptation of the last passages of the dialogue in "Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me" – at the very end of the track, it roughly goes: «Do you ever think that you actually would kill yourself? Well, if I have thought about it real, uh, real deep... yes, I believe I would.»
