Do I miss her?\
Or do I just feel lonely?\
Do I love her?\
Or am I disappointed?\
It must have happened to me\
Because I'm strong enough\
I had to reach the bottom\
At least I hope I did

When you were lying beside him\
You could still feel the sheets warm\
Warm as you and I had left them

Waves don't show respect\
For those who have something to give\
At most they would not trust them\
Creative-hearted people

We deal just fine now\
We do respect each other\
That doesn't help me\
I'm unable to detach from you

## About

Under the effect of what most people call love, we sometimes are unable to observe facts objectively, up to the point where we feel we are turning ourselves into masochists, self-inflicting pain.
