I don't want to be\
Buried here alive\
I want to get drunk\
Taking not a sip\
I don't want to read\
Any book tonight\
I just want to feel\
That fire burns inside

Sparks are emitted on the outside\
But the fuel lies inside you\
Strike together two hard stones\
And let the fire spread around you

I don't want to lie\
In the autumn sun\
Cannot not just revive\
My teenage emotions\
I don't want to read\
What I wrote last week\
I'd see me in each line\
But could not predict the next one
