Hey dad, do you remember that new student of mom's?\
He sometimes pays a visit, always when you're gone\
Once I felt like they wanted me to leave them two alone\
Did mom tell you what I saw when I went upstairs?!

It hurts\
I feel so alone

I washed away her black tears dried on my white pillow\
And so the perfume that the sheets had stolen from her\
The scar left by her cigarette on the back of my hand\
The harder I scratch, the longer it will last

## About

There is a kind of grief we can only face in loneliness; a kind of loneliness originating from grief itself; both grief and loneliness being simultaneously cause and effect of anger, in turn feeding grief and loneliness into a downward spiral.
