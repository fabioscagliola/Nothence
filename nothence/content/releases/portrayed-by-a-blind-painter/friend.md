If you want to be my friend\
It's time for you to realize\
That I don't want to share your tales\
About the way you fuck him

I don't think you know me\
Just because you saw me crying\
You've always got the answers to the questions\
That I haven't even asked

Take a picture of my hand\
And shake it on your own\
Take a picture of my lips\
And kiss it when you're alone

I don't see the reason why\
You stand so close to me\
I've never told you that I need your\
Support to stand tall

You keep complaining that your efforts\
Drain your energies\
But I guess the way it works between us\
It's the other way around

## About

The term friend is largely abused; mutual parasitism is often mistaken for a friendly relationship; people rarely are what we think they are.
