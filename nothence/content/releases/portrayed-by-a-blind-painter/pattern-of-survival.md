She wrote the story and she mailed it to the editor\
She delivered it herself and approved its publication. Now she\
Runs to the bookstore and points her finger to the copy\
Of her book in the window, but she knows\
That she's the only one who can see it

It does exist\
For you at least\
It's what you feel\
That makes it real

This is just another pattern\
A pattern of survival\
Just another crazy pattern\
A pattern of survival

He spends his days and nights accumulating knowledge\
Which he loves to share with the many friends he's got\
When he saw the freak on that video of him,\
He realized that nobody ever could\
Have understood one word he had spoken

If you exist\
For you at least\
It's what you feel\
That makes you real
