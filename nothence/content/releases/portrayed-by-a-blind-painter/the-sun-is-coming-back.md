After all this long, long rain of tears\
The sun is coming back\
The sky is clear again

## About

Matteo, my son, wrote these lyrics when I first played this song for him on a rainy afternoon, so much positively affecting the melancholic mood of my darkest times with the touch of his optimism. And I'm convinced that his words are not to be interpreted literally simply because he was only 11 years old at the time he wrote them.
