Where are you?\
Now that I'm looking for you\
Where are you?\
Anesthetic for my restless thoughts\
Without you\
I feel the need to love and be loved\
Make me insensitive\
Unaware, happily stoned

I wonder where you are now that I want you\
I wonder where you are now that I need you

When the heart\
Doesn't send and receive enough love\
The brain will start\
Asking questions and looking for answers\
But answers won't come\
All the answers lie in you\
I won't give up\
I will keep looking for you

## About

Questions without answers for wonderers in search of someone, something, or, most of the times, without even being aware of it, themselves.
