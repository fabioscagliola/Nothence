I hope I'll learn the rules before it's too late\
I will hold my position evolving by not moving\
You'll find me here, lying on the floor when you come knocking\
On my door; I don't want you by my side\
I'd rather be alone

Keep on looking ahead\
I will not change my mind\
I will keep on staring at the sun\
Until I go blind\
I won't change direction

Desperation made me hang on to you\
You and many other unlikely handholds until I learned\
It hurts even more, when you're hanging from a ledge collapsing and\
You fall with it; I rely on my strengths only\
I learned to be alone

## About

Few people are willing to make the deliberate choice of living life alone, refusing to share it with someone, declining to be part of a relationship, remaining in sole company of their true self; this is a challenge that most people are frightened to face.
