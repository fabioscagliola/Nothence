The pain originates from\
The throat and the chin\
Moves down to the chest now and spreads\
The heart's under siege\
Contractions of a tissue\
Beyond control\
The body suffers from what\
The mind was denied

The anger rises\
Defenses engage\
Enthusiasm is panic\
Going to give it up before the end

Look through pictures sliding on the glass\
Focus on the light ring and lose the grip\
The bright cone's spinning counterclockwise again\
No name you know to define yourself

The man in the mirror combs his\
His long golden curls\
Was told that he looked like an angel\
When he was a child\
He now feels like punching his chest and\
And crash into it\
To eradicate that grown hair\
That wraps up his heart

The room's still empty\
The heart loses beats\
Nothing translates to fire\
Still I'm not going to forget nor forgive

## About

When emotions become physical, when pain becomes ache, we feel not only we lose control of our body, we feel we lose our own identity. Still, paradoxically, there is more hope for those who reach the bottom and look up to the spinning light above.
