You try to be like others\
Just to feel you're someone\
You try to be different\
So you can blame somebody else\
You're lost in the context\
And still you feel alone\
Why didn't you tell me?!\
I could have spent some time\
Some time on my own

I'm glad I had the chance\
The chance to see you naked\
Be sure I won't regret!\
We don't share anything\
I'm glad without me you can\
Be yourself completely\
You don't have any boundaries\
That contain your sickness

You've never asked yourself why\
You want what you want\
Do you really need it?\
Or do they want you to do so?!\
You're lost in the context\
And still you feel someone\
You should have told me!\
I would have spent some time\
Some time on my own

## About

Loneliness can be a fallback choice for those who feel they cannot stand the hypocrisy of society and refuse to share their lives with those who (un)willingly take part in it.
